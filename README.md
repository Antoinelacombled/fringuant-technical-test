# Fringuant-technical-test

This website is a technical demonstration for Fringuant, a startup offering personalized and customized solutions for accurately determining clothing sizes during online shopping. The project aimed to create a web experience featuring a 3D human silhouette that reacts to webpage scrolling by rotating on its axis. The design needed to be creative and align with the fashion theme.

### Project Initialization:
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Run `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies.
* Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running `yarn start`.

### Technologies Used:
* React: Utilized for its component reusability.
* React Three Fiber and React Three Drei: Employed for 3D rendering and interaction.
* GSAP: Used for creating dynamic animations.
* Leva: Integrated for real-time GUI adjustments during development.
* Blender: Used for creating the 3D mannequin model.
* Photoshop: Applied to standardize the mannequin images.
* Figma: Used for initial mockup designs.

Development Process:
The design process began with creating minimalistic mockups on Figma, focusing on the core idea and mindful of the project's time constraints. The 3D mannequin, designed to explore refraction and lighting effects, was modeled in Blender. To align with the fashion theme, the mannequin was styled with Balanciaga-inspired accessories.
The project background was set to a subtle black, with text in contrasting white or gray, creating an elegant scrolling experience that unveils the mannequin from various angles.

### Challenges and Future Improvements:

Given additional time, I would restructure the project and explore the integration of Three.js's post-processing capabilities to add grain, enhancing the site's visual cohesion and aesthetic appeal. I would also enhance the animations to make the website more immersive. 

In conclusion, while the project met its basic objectives, further enhancements, including post-processing effects and ScrollTrigger integration, would elevate the user experience to align with my initial idea.
